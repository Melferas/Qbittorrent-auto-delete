; Configuration for torrent ratio logging and calculation

[torrent_ratio_logger]
; This section controls how the average ratio is calculated over time

; Maximum number of daily entries to keep in the ratio log for each torrent
; This determines the time period for average ratio calculation
; Default: 28 (representing 28 days or 4 weeks)
max_entries = 28

; Days at which to purge the oldest entry from the ratio log
; This helps to more fairly judge torrents that may have seeded well only in the first few days
; Format: comma-separated list of days
; Default: 8,16,24 (purge oldest entry on 8th, 16th, and 24th day)
; Set to empty (purge_days = ) to disable purging
purge_days = 8,16,24

[ratio_calculation]
; This section provides a boost to newer torrents to protect them from early deletion

; Minimum ratio to assign to new torrents that haven't reached min_weeks_seeded
; This prevents new torrents from being deleted too quickly if they start slowly
; Set to 0 to disable this feature
; Default: 0.3

; Number of weeks a torrent must be seeded before it's subject to normal ratio calculations
; Torrents seeded for less than this time will be assigned at least min_ratio_change
