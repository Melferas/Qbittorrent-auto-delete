[cleanup]
; Categories to consider when freeing up disk space (comma-separated, no spaces)
; Can be left empty: If empty, no categories will be checked for space cleanup
categories_to_check_for_space = EX1,EX2,EX3
; Categories to check for maximum number of torrents (comma-separated, no spaces)
; Can be left empty: If empty, no categories will be checked for number limits
categories_to_check_for_number = EX4
; Minimum free space to maintain on disk (in GB)
; Can be set to 0: If 0, space-based removal will be disabled
min_space_gb = 350
; Minimum free space to reserve for downloads (in GB)
; This setting ensures extra space is available for ongoing and future downloads.
; Can be left empty or set to 0: If empty or 0, this feature will not be used.
; How it works:
; 1. The script calculates the total size of all currently downloading torrents.
; 2. It then adds this value to download_minspace_gb to determine the total space needed.
; 3. If the available space is less than this total, the script will remove torrents
;    to free up enough space for both the ongoing downloads and this extra buffer.
; Example:
; If set to 35 and you're currently downloading 50GB of torrents:
;   - The script will try to ensure at least 85GB (50GB + 35GB) of free space.
;   - If less than 85GB is available, it will remove torrents to reach this target.
; This helps prevent disk space issues during large downloads or multiple simultaneous downloads.
; Set this value based on your typical download patterns and desired safety margin.
download_minspace_gb = 35
; Maximum number of torrents to keep for categories_to_check_for_number
; Required if categories_to_check_for_number is not empty
max_torrents_for_categories = 100
; Set to true to keep only the smallest torrents when enforcing max_torrents_for_categories
; Can be set to true or false:
; - If true: When removing torrents to meet the max_torrents_for_categories limit,
;   the script will prioritize removing larger torrents, keeping the smallest ones.
; - If false: The script will use the standard calculation based on average ratio change
;   to decide which torrents to remove. This takes into account seeding time, current ratio,
;   and any applicable bonus rules.
; The standard calculation typically favors keeping torrents that are performing well
; in terms of ratio increase over time, regardless of their size.
sort_count_removal_by_size = false
; Path to the drive to check for free space
; Can be left empty: If empty, the script will check the drive where it's located

[seed_rules]
; Define rules for each category
; Format: CATEGORY = min_seed_time:SECONDS, min_ratio:RATIO
; min_seed_time is in seconds, min_ratio is a decimal number
; Either min_seed_time or min_ratio can be omitted, but at least one should be present
; If both are present, a torrent will be eligible for removal if it meets either condition
EX1 = min_seed_time:540000, min_ratio:1.1
EX2 = min_seed_time:180000, min_ratio:1.2

[bonus_rules]
; Define bonus rules for categories that should have them
; This section can be left empty if no categories use bonus rules
; Format: CATEGORY = min_weeks:WEEKS, time_multipliers:WEEKS:MULTIPLIER,..., size_multipliers:SIZE_GB:MULTIPLIER,..., extra_multiplier_weeks:WEEKS, extra_multiplier_value:VALUE
; All parameters are optional, but at least one should be present for the category to use bonus rules

[torrent_ratio_logger]
; Maximum number of daily entries to keep in the ratio log for each torrent
; Can be set to 0: If 0, ratio logging will be disabled
max_entries = 28
; Days at which to purge the oldest entry from the ratio log (comma-separated)
; Can be left empty: If empty, no entries will be purged based on age
purge_days = 8,16,24

[ratio_calculation]
; Minimum ratio to assign to new torrents that haven't reached min_weeks_seeded
; Can be set to 0: If 0, new torrents will not get a minimum ratio assigned
min_ratio_change = 0.3
; Number of weeks a torrent must be seeded before it's subject to normal ratio calculations
; Can be set to 0: If 0, all torrents will be subject to normal ratio calculations immediately
min_weeks_seeded = 3

; To add a new category:
; 1. Add it to categories_to_check_for_space or categories_to_check_for_number in the [cleanup] section if needed
; 2. Add a new line in the [seed_rules] section with the category name and its rules
; 3. If it should use bonus rules, create a new entry in the [bonus_rules] section

; Example of adding a new category 'NEW_CAT':
; In [cleanup]: categories_to_check_for_space = EX1,EX2,EX3,NEW_CAT
; In [seed_rules]: NEW_CAT = min_seed_time:360000, min_ratio:1.5
; If it should have bonus rules:
; In [bonus_rules]: NEW_CAT = min_weeks:2, time_multipliers:4:1.2,8:1.5, size_multipliers:5:1.1,15:1.3, extra_multiplier_weeks:6, extra_multiplier_value:1.4
